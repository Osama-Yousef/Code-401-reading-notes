## NextJS Deployment

* The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next.js. Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global
CDN supporting static & Jamstack deployment and Serverless Functions.
* steps to do that :
  * Sign up to Vercel (no credit card is required).

  * After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an 
  integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).

  * Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the 
  build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work just fine!

  * After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.

  * Congratulations! You’ve just deployed your Next.js app! If you have questions, take a look at the Vercel documentation.
