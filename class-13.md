# Read:13 Summary
## How to run Linear regression in Python
* `Linear regression` : is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques. Whether you want to do statistics, machine learning, or scientific computing,
there are good chances that you’ll need it. It’s advisable to learn it first and then proceed towards more complex methods.
* `Regression analysis` : is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. There are many regression methods available. 
Linear regression is one of them.
* Regression searches for relationships among variables.
### When Do You Need Regression?
  * to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related
  * is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. 
  * Regression is used in many different fields: economy, computer science, social sciences, and so on
  
  
***Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of data and increased awareness of the practical value of data.***


* Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It’s among the simplest regression methods. 
One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.
* The package `scikit-learn` : is a widely used Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy and some other packages. It provides the means for preprocessing data,
reducing dimensionality, implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more. Like NumPy, scikit-learn is also open source.

* There are several ways in which you can do that, you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.
* Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection 
and dimensionality reduction.
* `sklearn.linear_model module` : which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the
input variables”.
* steps to begin working :
  * import the required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook.
  * import data set into Ipython notebook and store it in a variable
  * convert data into a pandas data frame
  * etc ...
* Residual plots are a good way to visualize the errors in your data. If you have done a good job then your data should be randomly scattered around line zero. 
If you see structure in your data, that means your model is not capturing some thing

### There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:

  * Import the packages and classes you need.
    * `import numpy as np`

    * `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`


  * Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.

  * Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.

  * Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.

  * Apply the model for predictions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Types(cases) of the linear ewgression :
  * Multiple Linear Regression With scikit-learn

  * Polynomial Regression With scikit-learn
  
  * Advanced Linear Regression With statsmodels

* Linear regression is sometimes not appropriate, especially for non-linear models of high complexity.
* we use NumPy for handling arrays.
#### Linear regression is implemented with the following:

  * `scikit-learn` : if you don’t need detailed results and want to use the approach consistent with other regression techniques
  * `statsmodels` : if you need the advanced statistical parameters of a model
