# Read:14 Summary
## Data Visualization
## Matplotlib tutorial
* `matplotlib`: is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It
provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and
publication-quality figures in many formats.  We are going to explore
matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.

* `IPython and the pylab mode` : is an enhanced interactive Python shell that
has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to
shell commands, improved debugging and much more. When we start it with the
command line argument -pylab (--pylab since IPython version 0.12), it allows
interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.
* `pyplot` : provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented
plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the
majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar
arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

## seaborn tutorial
* `Seaborn` : is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.

* Here is some of the functionality that seaborn offers:

  * A dataset-oriented API for examining relationships between multiple variables

  * Specialized support for using categorical variables to show observations or aggregate statistics

  * Options for visualizing univariate or bivariate distributions and for comparing them between subsets of data

  * Automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models for different kinds dependent variables

  * Convenient views onto the overall structure of complex datasets

  * High-level abstractions for structuring multi-plot grids that let you easily build complex visualizations

  * Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several built-in themes

  * Tools for choosing color palettes that faithfully reveal patterns in your data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on dataframes 
and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.

## Bokeh Tutorial
* `Bokeh` : is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation.***It is good for:***

  * Interactive visualization in modern browsers
  * Standalone HTML documents, or server-backed apps
  * Expressive and versatile graphics
  * Large, dynamic or streaming data
  * Easy usage from python (or Scala, or R, or...)
  * And most importantly: ***NO JAVASCRIPT REQUIRED***
* `Bokeh` : is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and 
affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, 
dashboards, and data applications.
