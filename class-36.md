## Whiteboard Advice
*  whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper,
or computer during the interview. This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apart.
### The Advice: Communicate!
* The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like
an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.
#### First, Restate the Question
  * Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you
  don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past. 
  * The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand. There is no situation in which 
  restating the problem will hurt you — it shows you can articulate a problem and gives you time to think it through a bit while you discuss.
  Furthermore, starting the discussion this way will help quell some nerves that might otherwise manifest while trying to solve the actual challenge
#### Ask About Edge Cases
  * It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask 
  about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s great — it shows you’re analytical 
  and will work hard to try to prevent bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).
  * “Now that I confirmed my understanding of the problem, I’d like to ask about some potential edge cases. Is it possible that the input would be a type
  other than a number? If so, what should the function do? Can the input be 0 or negative? Again, if so, what should the function do?”
#### Ask About Test Cases
  * This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting
  you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate 
  knows about testing!”
#### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
  * Again, you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other
  idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing
  pseudocode and fill in the actual code later. (Coincidentally, this is a reasonable way to write actual code as well).
  * Here’s the kicker: you can ask if your pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer. It’s possible they will be the type that doesn’t want to “give you 
  hints,” but it’s also possible they’ll be more interested in how you think and want to discuss your pseudocode with you. When I interview candidates, 
  I’m more interested in the latter — rarely do we ever actually develop software in a vacuum.
  * In other words, in the worst case the interviewer will tell you to continue without actually offering feedback. In the best case, the interviewer
  might actually point out logical flaws in your pseudocode that will give you some serious benefit when transitioning to actual code.
  * If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code, you have actually earned a lot of points by now! Sure, in 
  some elite companies they won’t accept anything but functional code, but simply being able to reason through the pseudocode is sufficient for many great companies.
#### Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
  * You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate 
  code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. 
  If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.
  * At this point, don’t hesitate to ask if your solution looks good! If it doesn’t they might offer some tips to improve it. All of this communication
  scores points for you — you’ll seem articulate and easier to work with if you’re willing to objectively discuss ways to improve your work.
#### Stuck? Ask for Help!
  * If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.
#### Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview
  * You should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview. Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the
  interview? Ask them! Furthermore, you can ask if there is anything in particular you should prepare. They very well might give you hints like specifying 
  the language in which they’ll ask questions, the number of questions, the style of question (e.g., develop an algorithm vs. find the bug). They might tell 
  you whether you’ll be sitting at a computer or standing at a whiteboard — very useful information you might be able to use to practice or, at the very least,
  mentally prepare.
#### We’re All Human
  * Above all, remember that we’re all human. Your interviewer has been in your position and understands the stress of a technical interview. Your interviewer 
  has probably seen quite a few candidates sweating it out, but possibly very few open who openly discuss problems in a conversational manner. If you can achieve
  this, you’ll be in great shape.
#### What Has Your Experience Been?
  * Have you been in a technical interview where communication saved you? Have you had the opposite experience? Let me know in the comments! I’d love to hear 
  about your experiences

## 7 tips to ace a programming interview
### Take a few minutes.
  * Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews. The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”.
  What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump
  straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.

  * Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.

  * nstead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer:
    “Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”
  * Shut your eyes, stare at the ceiling, scribble on the whiteboard — whatever it takes. Think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach. Then
     re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded. Don’t forget to provide your reasoning!

### Write down the steps of the solution.
  * Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it
    on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.
### Write pseudocode first.
  * Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and
  there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the
  structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.
  * Even if we never make it to writing code, many interviewers will consider this a solution to the problem. It proves that we understood the problem, devised
  the correct solution, and are well on our way towards implementing it in code.
### Don’t sweat the small stuff.
  * Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. 
  They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it 
  off and move on.
  * If you can’t remember something like this, it’s often acceptable to say that you’d look it up.
  * Let’s be honest, half of being a programmer is knowing how to Google stuff and how to interpret search results. We use the internet as a giant cache for all 
  the information that we “almost” remember but don’t bother to, since we can just look it up at any time. It’d be hard to fault an answer like the one above. So 
  don’t waste time memorizing keywords in your interview prep. Focus on the big picture.
### Sit down. Be humble.
  * A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. For example:
       * Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
       * Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
       * How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
       * Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
       * Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
       * Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
  * If you are given criticism in an interview, you need to take it and be grateful for it. No snide remarks, no “oh, I was gonna do that in a second anyway”, 
  no anger or raised voice. The interviewer has their opinion, and they didn’t have to share it — they could’ve just written it down silently and rejected you 
  as a candidate later. They’ve given you a chance to correct course because they think you’re worth it, and they’ve extended an opportunity for you to demonstrate
  how you accept feedback from your peers. Don’t waste it.

### Come prepared.
  * When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). If you want to be ready, you have to put in
  the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and 
  afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, 
  regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.
  * To pretty much everyone that I coach through interviews, I recommend the same personal interview prep bible: Cracking the Coding Interview, by Gail Laakman
  McDowell. Like myself, Gail’s been at Facebook and Google, but as a former member of the Google Hiring Committee, Gail is qualified to speak authoritatively on the 
  software hiring process (and able to speak in detail about the Google hiring process, which I cannot due to my employment contract). This book’s been around for
  years and almost every engineer I’ve met at Google or Facebook (including myself) has completed it cover-to-cover. If you want to get the most value out of your HOBIS,
  I cannot recommend CtCI enough.
### Review your work.
  * You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting 
  to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible.
  * Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, 
  high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.
  * In particular, focus on these two areas, as they receive heavy scrutiny in interviews:
    * `Algorithmic efficiency`. Have you found the fastest and most optimal solution given the requirements? Take some time and consider other approaches. It’s worth
    noting two things here: 1) If the problem involves a sorted dataset, you can bet your pants there’s a solution involving ` O(log(n)) lookup time (even if there’s
    additional cost, the total complexity will still contain the log(n), for example, O(n * log(n)) if iterating over an array, as sorting algorithms do), and 2) For
    a disgustingly large number of programming interview questions, the answer involves a hash table and O(1) lookup time — so if you’re seeking a better 
    algorithm, try a hash table.
    * `Correctness`. Sure, you’ve solved for the simple, easy use case, but have you checked for edge cases? Off-by-one errors? Issues with negative numbers
    or empty arrays or missing keys or strings with weird patterns of characters? Maybe you won’t find all of them, but failing to at least LOOK for edge 
    cases before declaring your solution to be correct is a pretty hefty mistake in an interview.
