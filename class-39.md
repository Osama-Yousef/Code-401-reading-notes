# Read:39 Summary
## React Router
* is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable 
URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!

## React - Styling FAQ
### How do I add CSS classes to components?
  * Pass a string as the className prop

* CSS classes are generally better for performance than inline styles.

* “CSS-in-JS” refers to a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files.

* Note that this functionality is not a part of React, but provided by third-party libraries. React does not have an opinion about how 
styles are defined; if in doubt, a good starting point is to define your styles in a separate *.css file as usual and refer to 
them using className.
* React can be used to power animations. See React Transition Group and React Motion or React Spring

## NextJs
#### To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

  * Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
  * You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
  * You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
  * You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
  
* A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. 
It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.


***Next.js: The React Framework***


* Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when
building React applications.
* Next.js has the best-in-class "Developer Experience" and many built-in features; a sample of them are:

  * An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
  * Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
  * Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
  * Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
  * Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
  * Development environment with Fast Refresh support
  * API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
  * Fully extendable
* Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.
